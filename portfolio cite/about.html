     <p>My name is Lauren Roberts I am from Murrieta CA, and I am currently studying Graphic Design at Otis Collge of Art in Design in Los Angeles. 

     Throughout my childhood I went through that phrase were I wanted to do it all. I went from veternarian to swim instructure and artist. And even considered architect. But it wasn’t until attending Murrieta Mesa High School I began to get involved in the visual performing arts pathway were I took graphic design courses that I knew it was for me.

     I love being able to express myself in a create way whether it’s through typography,
     image-making, or photography.

     I love spending time with my family and friends, watching movies, going to Disneyland, laughing, loving life, cooking, and cleaning to decompress. These are just a few things that  I find inspiration from.</p>
