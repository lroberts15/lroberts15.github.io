        <h1>   Reading Response: “ The Web’s Grain”</h1>
    <p> After Reading “ The Web’s Grain” some of the main things that I began to take into consideration were the connections between the fluidity of a page, responsive  design, and edgelessness.  Frank describes fluidity by stating “ it adapts to the width of the viewpoint it fills up.” One example that helped me have a better understanding of this is when Frank uses the simile of a layered cake. Just like how a cake is stacked in layers, different components of a web page are automatically set up the same way because, it manages on all different screen sizes. However, this default setting can lead to issues in responsive design. For instance, Frank decides to change the code, so that his image is next to the text instead of under it. Once he did this there was an immediate change in both of text and the image. Because the image is fixed it grows with the page but, because the text is not fixed it shrinks as it grows. At this point I began to understand how different elements on a webpage can affect one another based on their proportions. Furthermore, I was able to make the connection regarding a webpage with a fixed design vs. a responsive design. Out of all the explanations that were given in this reading the example including David Hockney's work completely opened my mind about web design. In his early work with polaroids we see how he sticks to a gridded system, and how everything falls into an equally proportionate space. But once he starts experimenting with his work he plays with the idea of layering and breaks out of the frame. This leads to the idea of edgelesness and it’s relationship in web design. Web design is “ an edgelessness surface of unknown proportions, comprised of small, individual, and variable elements from multiple vantages assembled into a readable whole that documents a movement.”  Overall the reading made me realize how connected the different elements within web design affect one another. Even the elements that are s small as a grain.
